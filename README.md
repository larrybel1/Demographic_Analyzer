# demographic_analyzer
In this project, I created two Python files that talk with each other. In main.py, the user can implement any list, of any size they would like. From there it communicates with demographic_data_analyzer.py. demographic_data_analyzer.py also communicates with adult_data.csv which is the data that it runs specific statistics on. This data come from the 1994 Census.test_module.py simply runs the code to ensure it works and is accurate.

*** NOTE *** These three code files came from a template provided by freeCodeCamp. Although main.py and test_module.py are largely unmodified, the code in mean_var_std.py is mine and of my own creation.
